    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is part of an ongoing series of posts about Homesick, <a href="/blog/2014/11/02/starting-out-with-homesick/">my bachelor project</a>.</p>

<p>Perhaps prematurely, I’ve started first with the Android client of the Homesick project. </p>

<p>The Android side of the client is hosted <a href="https://github.com/ramonh/homesick-app">here</a>.</p>

<p>I’ll be using Android Studio to develop the client. This is also my first experience with an IntelliJ-like environment, so it should be very interesting!</p>

<p>I was very happy to see I could install plugins. To do so, I did the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open Preferences (On OS X, it’s in the “Android Studio” menu)</li>
  <li>On the left side, under IDE Settings, select “plugins”</li>
  <li>Click on “Install JetBrains plugins”</li>
</ol>

<p>One plugin I immediately downloaded was IdeaVim, which lets me use Vim keys in Android Studio.</p>

<p>Once I’ve done that and set the Darcula theme with some tweaks, I was all set to start!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My Bachelor project is called “Homesick App”, the description being as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Develop a mobile app that exchange the sounds created by the city you live in with the sounds of your home city. Requires implementing a server for sound upload and categorization (to be done by the app automatically in the background, classification e.g. into “traffic”, “market”, etc.) and of a feature-based classification app that is able to understand the current sound environment and to replace it (over earphones) with cached sounds from the place that you chose on installing the app. An example: The app should help to make someone from Mumbai feel at home in Zurich. Requires good knowledge in audio signal processing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For my part, I’ll need to have a basic server that receives recorded sound from an Android client, also developed by me, classifies it by machine learning and then sends back an appropriate sound. Doesn’t have to be the equivalent.</p>

<p>Over the next few blog posts, I’ll try to document how I develop the application.</p>

<p>Current plan is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Android client will be developed in <a href="https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html">Android Studio</a> (trying it for the first time).</li>
  <li>Server side code will be a <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> app.</li>
</ul>
